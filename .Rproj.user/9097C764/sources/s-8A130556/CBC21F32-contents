%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
This function merges GXcurve class data from seperate machines into one file. It screens the recording numbers in each measurement and reports the following three human errors: 1. Duplicate names. Ideally the name recording for leaves are unique. But it is possible that during operation people accidentally put in a wrong name, resulting to a name duplication for another leaf. 2. Miss name recording. As mentioned before names are recorded by inserting "remarks" in between two measurements. Sometimes people forgot to add remark. 3. Recording Interruption. When recording, errors might occur or the position of leaf needs to be adjusted, thus leading to too few recording in that measurement.

\arguments{
  \item{table}{
  GXcurve class table. If inputting single file, then this function does only screening.
%%     ~~Describe \code{table} here~~
}
  \item{\dots}{
  If inputing more than one GXcurve class table, these tables will first be merged and then screened.
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
}
}
\details{
57 or 58 records for each individual measurement is normal.
The screening process finds the consecutive recording that exceed 58, caused by missing name remarks in between measurements. Then it finds the discontinuous observations that exceeds 58 under the same name across the dataset, which is caused by duplicate names (human typo). Interuptions in the measurement is found by screening observation records smaller than 57.

}
\value{
Returns a GXcurve class table. Three types of human errors are summarized and saved in table attributes.
